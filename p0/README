The tar includes the following files:
lab0.c which is the C program,
Makefile which is the Makefile,
2 .png files that are the screenshots.

Smoke-test cases are presented by 'make check' in the following way:
Each block represents one test.
At the start of each test, a line will be printed stating what the test is about.
From the description, we should be able to tell whether this case is trying to raise an error or succeed.
Then, code used for the test will be printed, and we can examine the output of those code to see if they are expected.
If failed, make will log the error (with the exit status) and then proceed.
