The tarball contains:
lab1a.c: The C program;
README: This file;
Makefile: Including lab1a, clean, dist;

Research:
Manual pages of syscalls;
TA PPT;

Feature:
Without --shell, the program echos what is printed out after a buffer is filled.
The default buffer size is 1 so it prints on the go.
Changing local variable buf_size changes the buffer size, obviously.

With the --shell option, the program acts the same as what the spec says (hopefully).

Testing Method:
1. Test without --shell with buffer size 8 and terminates with ^D;
2. Test without --shell with buffer size 8 and terminates with ^C;
3. Test without --shell with buffer size 1;
4. Test with --shell, all commands have correct syntax, terminate with ^C;
5. Test with --shell, all commands have correct syntax, terminate with ^D, check that exit status is 0;
6. Test with --shell, last command has incorrect syntax, terminate with ^C;
7. Test with --shell, last command has incorrect syntax, terminate with ^D, check that exit status is not 0;
8. Test with the provided test script;
